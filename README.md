## Motivation

- vxunderground black mass volume 1

## Goals

- a client/server framework capable of implementing the RedKing protocol 
- ability to use the network for arbitrary file storage
- ability to use the network for arbitrary file retrieval
- ability to attach custom functionality and distribute it through the network
- ability to encrypt and sign messages distributed through the network
- ability to verify received messages in order to protect against bad actors
- small-world network properties (or N=6 variant)

## Current Work / TODO

- [x] Beginning of a node that can act as both the starting server as well as a subsequent connecting node
    - [ ] on node connect to server, both nodes should store the virtual address of its neighbor
        - [x] connecting node shares its virtual address with the server
        - [ ] connecting node should also open a port briefly and share that port number with the server
        - [ ] server should store the connecting virtual address, ip, and port, and then send back its own virtual address to the connecting node on the port that they specified
        - [ ] once the exchange has finished, both nodes should now list each other in their neighbors map
    - [x] server waits for subsequent connections and handles them
    - [ ] threaded so that we can accept new connections while doing other work
